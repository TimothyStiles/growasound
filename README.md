Hey igem peoples and others. This is just a neat little proof of concept that turns an image into a sound.


## Usage

<code>cd</code> into the project and then execute <code>lein run</code> and you
should hear a sound!

If you haven't installed leiningen instructions can be found [here](https://leiningen.org/).

The first time you run the code you should run <code>lein deps</code> just to 
make sure that your system has all of the depencies.

On your first run it may be a little slow! No worries [Overtone](http://overtone.github.io/) is just installing.
